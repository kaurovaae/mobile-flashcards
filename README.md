## Data
To store decks and flashcards `AsyncStorage` is used.

Each deck creates a new key on the object. 
Each deck has a `title` and a `questions key. 
`Title` is the title for the specific deck.
`Questions` is an array of questions and answers for that deck.

Project starts with the test data: 

<pre>
{
  React: {
    title: 'React',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is React?',
        answer: 'A library for managing user interfaces'
      },
      {
        question: 'Where do you make Ajax requests in React?',
        answer: 'The componentDidMount lifecycle event'
      }
    ]
  },
  JavaScript: {
    title: 'JavaScript',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is a closure?',
        answer: 'The combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.'
      }
    ]
  }
}
</pre>
